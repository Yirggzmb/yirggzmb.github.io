		This site was created largely to store things I've done, related to hobbies,  that I think are generally useful or interesting. Social media is fantastic, but it's also very ephemeral. There's not really any proper organization or even reasonable assurance things will stick around. A static webpage designed on my computer and uploaded to a host is about as stable as you're going to get on the web, and even if I someday have to or want to change hosts, the information still exists under my control.
